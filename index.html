      <p>Gretings! My name is Greg Randall. Welcome to my Personal Portfolio site! Here you can learn a bit about me and my professional skillsets.</p>

      <p>Since 2009 I have worked full-time in the Food & Beverage industry, first as a bar back, then as a full-fledged bartender. Working in the bar industry has taught me a wealth of knowledge not only of the alcohol industry (distilled spirits, wine varieties, beer styles, ect.), but also small business management and exceptional customer service. I intend to bring these skillsets into a future career in Full Stack Web development.</p>

      <p>I am currently attending classes in FSWD at Harvard Extension Schools. My goal is to graduate the course with all the necessary knowlege I will need to begin an exciting new career in web development, either within the Greater Boston area or beyond. If you would like more information about available certificate programs, vitit <a href="https://bootcamp.extension.harvard.edu/"><u>https://bootcamp.extension.harvard.edu/</u></a></p>
